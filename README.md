# Daily Expense Manager 1.0 - 'term' SQL Injection
SQL injection in Daily Expense Manager 1.0 allows for injection of SQL queries, resulting in information disclosure and remote code execution.

## Vulnerable Code
File: /Daily-Expense-Manager/readxp.php , Line: 16-23
```
<?php
include("functions.php");

if(isloggedin()==FALSE)
{

}
else
{
  
}
$sid=$_SESSION['id'];


//get search term
$searchTerm = $_GET['term'];
//get matched data from skills table
$query = $conn->query("SELECT * FROM expense WHERE pname like '%$searchTerm%' AND uid='$sid' and isdel='0' group by pname");
while ($row = $query->fetch_assoc()) {
    $data[] = $row['pname'];
}
//return json data
echo json_encode($data);
?>
```
The LoggedIn() function effectively does nothing to prevent unauthenticated users from accessing this file.
The `$SearchTerm` variable is not sanitized and is under control of the attacker.

## Proof-of-concept
The HTTP request below injects a UNION statement to retrieve the version of the underlying database.
